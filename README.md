# Natural Language Processing Project for E-Commerce Users Reviews and Ratings

In this NLP project we will be attempt to classify Women's E-Commerce Clothing Reviews into 1 star or 5 star categories based off the text content in the reviews. We will utilize the pipeline methods with Multinomial Naive Bayes.

Each observation in this dataset is a review of a particular product by a particular user.

We will use the Women's E-Commerce Clothing Reviews Data Set from Kaggle with 23,000 reviews and ratings (found [here](https://github.com/javadfarshchi/Natural-Language-Processing-E-Commerce-Review/blob/main/NLP_Project_E_Commerce.ipynb)).

The "ratings" column is the number of stars (1 through 5) assigned by the reviewer to the product. (Higher rating is better.) In other words, it is the rating of the product by the person who wrote the review.
